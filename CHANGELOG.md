# Changelog

## [1.7.0] Improved logging (2026-xx-xx)

### Internal
* Log the `Content-Type`, `Origin` and `Sec-Fetch-*` header values for each request.
* Added request completion time logging.
* For `POST` requests, log the size of the request body.

## [1.6.0] Improved Key-Capsule Expiry Logic & secp265 Support (2025-12-01)

### Features
* Add `x-expiry-time-adjusted` header to `GET /key-capsules/{transactionId}` result as specified in [cdoc2-key-capsules 2.2.0 OAS](https://github.com/open-eid/cdoc2-openapi)
  Changed the behavior of the `x-expiry-time` header in the `POST /key-capsules/{transactionId}`.
  Now if the `x-expiry-time` is larger than the maximum allowed expiry time, then the expiry
  time is set as the maximum allowed value.
  If the expiry time value was adjusted, then the header `x-expiry-time-adjusted` in the endpoint `GET /key-capsules/{transactionId}`
  will be set to `true`.
* Add support for `secp265` elliptic curve to `cdoc2-get-server` and `cdoc2-put-server`.

### Internal
* Use `spring-boot-dependencies` BOM for `cdoc2-server` parent POM for easier version alignment with `cdoc2-put-server` and `cdoc2-get-server` that use `spring-boot-starter-parent` parent
